## Using Your API Key to Make API Calls

Once you have [obtained your API key](/instructions/get-api-key), you can use it to interact with the Whop API endpoints listed in the GraphQL documentation at [graphql.whop.tech](https://graphql.whop.tech).

### Making a GraphQL API Call

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have a tool or library to make HTTP requests, such as `curl`, Postman, or a GraphQL client in your preferred programming language.

2. **Prepare Your Request**:
   - **Endpoint**: Use the GraphQL endpoint `https://api.whop.com/graphql`.
   - **Headers**: Include your API key in the headers to authenticate your request.
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```

3. **Craft Your Query**: Write your GraphQL query or mutation. For example, to retrieve user data:
   ```graphql
   query {
     user {
       id
       name
       email
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Send the Request**: Use your tool to send the request to the GraphQL endpoint.

5. **Handle the Response**: Process the response from the server, which will include the data requested or any errors encountered.

### Example Request Using `curl`

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.whop.com/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "query": "query { user { id name email } }" }'
```

This example demonstrates how to make a simple API call to retrieve user information using your API key. Adjust the query and headers as needed for different endpoints and data requirements.
