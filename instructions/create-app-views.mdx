### What are App Views?

App views are a way to host custom experiences in your app. They are a great way to add custom functionality to your app. Use this to host a game, a SaaS, or anything digital.

### How to create an App View

1. Go to https://whop.com/dashboard.
2. Navigate to Settings -> API Keys.
3. [Create an app](/instructions/get-api-key) if you haven't already.
4. Set your app's base URL to your own site's base URL.
5. Click on the `Create App View` button.
6. Enter a path for your app view. This is the extension on top of the base URL that leads to the experience you want to host.
7. Click on the `Create` button.

### Different types of App Views

There are 3 different types of App Views:

1. **Hub**: This is the customer facing experience. This is what your customers will see when they navigate to the app view.
2. **Dashboard**: This is an internal facing experience for the business. This is where you can manage any settings or dashboards you may want to host.
3. **Analytics**: This is an internal facing experience for the business to see analytics about the app view.

### Usage

Install your hub app view on your Whop in the Integrations section. You can also add the dashboard and analytics app views to your Whop to manage and monitor your app view.

And you're done! You've now created a custom experience in your app.
