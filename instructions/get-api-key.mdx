All API calls are authenticated using either an App API key or a Company API key:
- **Apps API**: Lets you create applications that other people can use and you can monetize as a developer. Best for building agents, tools and experiences for other people on the Whop platform.
- **Company API**: Best for when you want to automate your own creator account or sync payments/crm data to your internal systems.
