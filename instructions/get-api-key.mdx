title: Get an API Key
description: You can either get your own API key to automate your own user account, or you can oauth another user to make calls on behalf of their user.
---


You have two options when getting a key to make API calls:
- **Your own API key**: Personal, secure, for automating your account.
- **Another user's API key**: Requires permission, for accessing and managing another user's account.

### Getting your own API key

To retrieve your own API key, visit your profile at [https://whop.com/@me](https://whop.com/@me). Once logged in, navigate to the 'API Keys' section and click on 'Generate New Key'. Your new API key will be displayed. Make sure to store it securely.

### Getting another user's API key

To generate an OAuth link for another user, use the following endpoint:

```
POST https://api.whop.com/oauth/authorize
```

Include the following parameters in your request:

- `client_id`: Your application's client ID.
- `redirect_uri`: The URL to redirect the user after authorization.
- `response_type`: Set this to `code`.
- `scope`: Specify the permissions your application needs.

Example request:

```
POST https://api.whop.com/oauth/authorize
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "redirect_uri": "https://yourapp.com/callback",
  "response_type": "code",
  "scope": "read write"
}
```

After the user authorizes your application, they will be redirected to your specified `redirect_uri` with an authorization code. Use this code to request an access token.
