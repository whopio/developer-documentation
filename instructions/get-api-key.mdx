description: All requests to Whop APIs are managed using a secure API key.

All API calls are authenticated using either an App API key or a Company API key:
- **Apps API**: Lets you create applications that other people can use and you can monetize as a developer. Best for building agents, tools and experiences for other people on the Whop platform.
- **Company API**: Best for when you want to automate your own creator account or sync payments/crm data to your internal systems.


### Getting your App API Key

1. Create a user account on https://whop.com/login, navigate to https://whop.com/@me, and enable developer mode in the bottom right corner.
2. Go to whop.new to create a new Organization that will hold your app. (If you are already a creator on Whop, you can skip this step and use your existing organization)
3. Go to https://whop.com/dashboard, click **"New whop"**, check the **"Make this an App"** box, and give your app a name.
4. On the App detail view, click the "Api keys" tab and copy your API key to your clipboard.
