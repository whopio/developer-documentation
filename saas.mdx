A License Key is a unique identifier generated by Whop for each user who has made a purchase. It acts like a special access code that users can input to gain access to your application.

---

## When to use license keys

License Keys are useful when you want to sell & restrict access to desktop applications. For example, if you're selling a game, you can use license keys to restrict access to users who have purchased the game.

## Creating a License Key

If you haven't already [created your company](https://docs.whop.com/creating-company) or [made a product to sell](https://docs.whop.com/creating-company#creating-your-first-product), you'll want to start there.

Once you've done that, head to the dashboard to add the license key experience to your product.

<Warning>
  A download link is required to add a **Software** experience. This is the link
  that will appear in the user's dashboard to download the software.
</Warning>

## Getting your API key

For the endpoints below, you'll need to use your API key. You can find your API key in the dashboard under the `Developer` tab.

<Warning>
  You must keep your API keys safe and secure - if not properly scoped, your API
  keys can be dangerous if they fall into the wrong hands.
</Warning>

### Creating an API key

1. Head to your [Developers settings](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) page
2. Click **New API Key**
3. Set a memorable name for your key.
4. Copy the API key

<Note>
  We recommend you scope your API key for this use case. For more details, click
  [here](/api-reference/v5/authentication#scoped-api-keys)

## Metadata

Metadata is a way to store information about a license key. The most common use case for this is to store information about the user's device, HWID. **Hardware ID** is a unique identifier for a device, and can be used to prevent users from sharing their license keys with others.

<Warning>
  The user can reset their metadata anytime by going to their dashboard and
  clicking the `Reset Key` button.
</Warning>

#### How to get a user's HWID

<CodeGroup>
    ```js JavaScript
    const machineId = require('node-machine-id');

    function generate_hwid() {
        return machineId.machineIdSync();
    }
    ```

```python Python
import hashlib
import platform

def generate_hwid():
    return hashlib.sha256(platform.node().encode()).hexdigest().strip()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating a License Key

The metadata field in the body is **required**. If you do not wish to set any metadata, you can pass an empty object.

```json
{ "metadata": {} }
```

<CodeGroup>
    ```js JavaScript
    import fetch from "node-fetch";

    async function validateLicense(licenseKey, HWID) {
        const url = `https://api.whop.com/api/v2/memberships/${licenseKey}/validate_license`;
        const payload = {
            metadata: {
                HWID: HWID,
            },
        };
        const headers = {
            Accept: "application/json",
            Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        };

        const response = await fetch(url, {
            method: "POST",
            headers: headers,
            body: JSON.stringify(payload),
        });

        return response;
    }
    ```

    ```python Python
    import requests

    def validate_license(license_key, HWID):

        url = f"https://api.whop.com/api/v2/memberships/{license_key}/validate_license"

        payload = {"metadata": {"HWID": HWID}}
        headers = {
            "accept": "application/json",
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
            "content-type": "application/json"
        }
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
        return response
    ```
