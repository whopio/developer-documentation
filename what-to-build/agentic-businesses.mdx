## Why build an agentic business on Whop?

Whop gives you the infrastructure to launch and sell fast:

- **Built-in payments** — Sell access instantly with pricing options  
- **Built-in community** — Use chats and forums to engage customers  
- **Built-in growth** — Get exposure via Whop's marketplace, SEO, and content rewards  

You still need to build the agent logic — but Whop handles the distribution, onboarding, monetization, and user experience so you don't have to reinvent everything around it.

## Example agentic businesses

### Daily Sports Picks

**Customer Journey:**  
- User lands on your Whop store and sees a headline about today's games  
- They subscribe to get daily picks posted in a private forum or chat  
- The AI posts daily betting advice, updates game commentary, and sends recaps  
- Users ask questions or engage — AI replies or creates reactions  
- You retain users with content rewards, chat banter, and occasional DMs

___

**Step 1: Create a Whop**

Use the `createAccessPass` mutation to generate a store with a relevant title:

```graphql
mutation {
  createAccessPass(input: {
    title: "BetBot Daily Picks",
    headline: "AI-generated daily sports betting picks and commentary"
  }) {
    id
    route
  }
}
```

___

**Step 2: Create a Pricing Option**

The `createPlan` mutation allows you to set the pricing model for the store:

```graphql
mutation createPlan {
  createPlan(input: { 
    accessPassId: "your_access_pass_id", 
    planType: renewal,
    billingPeriod: 30,
    renewalPrice: 15.00, 
    baseCurrency: usd 
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

___

**Step 3: Daily Forum Post**

Each day, the agent generates a new post:

```graphql
mutation createForumPost {
  createForumPost(input: { 
    experienceId: "exp_123",
    title: "April 3rd Picks: NBA + MLB",
    body: "Suns ML, Over 213.5 in Knicks game. MLB: Take Braves -1.5"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

___

**Step 4: Update Store Headline**

Highlight urgency based on that day's games.

```graphql
mutation updateAccessPass {
  updateAccessPass(input: { 
    accessPassId: "your_access_pass_id", 
    headline: "New Store Headline" 
  }) {
    accessPass {
      id
      headline
    }
  }
}
```

___

**Step 5: Send Chat Messages**

Post picks to live chat for active users:

```graphql
mutation sendMessage {
  sendMessage(input: { 
    experienceId: "EXPERIENCE_ID", 
    message: "Locking in Suns ML tonight. Anyone riding?"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

___

**Step 6: Create a Content Reward**

Encourage users to post TikToks in exchange for free days:

```graphql
mutation createContentRewardsCampaign($input: CreateCampaignInput!) {
  createContentRewardsCampaign(input: $input) {
    id
    experience {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

___

**Step 7: Send a Chat Message**

Optional — follow up with engaged users.

```graphql
mutation sendMessage {
  sendMessage(input: { 
    toUserId: "user_123", 
    message: "Saw you hit last night's parlay — appreciate you being here" 
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```
