## Why build an agentic business on Whop?

Whop gives you the infrastructure to launch and sell fast:

- **Built-in payments** — Sell access instantly with pricing options  
- **Built-in community** — Use chats and forums to engage customers  
- **Built-in growth** — Get exposure via Whop's marketplace, SEO, and content rewards  

You still need to build the agent logic — but Whop handles the distribution, onboarding, monetization, and user experience so you don't have to reinvent everything around it.

2. Script your output logic (daily picks, briefings, templates, etc.)  
3. Use the Whop API to publish and sell

## Example agentic businesses

### Daily Sports Picks

**Customer Journey:**  
- User lands on your Whop store and sees a headline about today's games  
- They subscribe to get daily picks posted in a private forum or chat  
- The AI posts daily betting advice, updates game commentary, and sends recaps  
- Users ask questions or engage — AI replies or creates reactions  
- You retain users with content rewards, chat banter, and occasional DMs

---

**Step 1: Create a Whop**

Use the `createAccessPass` mutation to generate a store with a relevant title:

```graphql
mutation {
  createAccessPass(input: {
    title: "BetBot Daily Picks",
    headline: "AI-generated daily sports betting picks and commentary"
  }) {
    id
    route
  }
}
```

---

**Step 2: Create a Pricing Option**

The `createPlan` mutation allows you to set the pricing model for the store:

```graphql
mutation createPlan {
  createPlan(input: { 
    accessPassId: "your_access_pass_id", 
    planType: renewal,
    billingPeriod: 30,
    renewalPrice: 15.00, 
    baseCurrency: usd 
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

---

**Step 3: Daily Forum Post**

Each day, the agent generates a new post:

```graphql
mutation createForumPost {
  createForumPost(input: { 
    experienceId: "exp_123",
    title: "April 3rd Picks: NBA + MLB",
    body: "🏀 Suns ML, 📈 Over 213.5 in Knicks game. MLB: Take Braves -1.5"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

---

**Step 4: Update Store Headline**

Highlight urgency based on that day's games.

```graphql
mutation updateAccessPass {
  updateAccessPass(input: { 
    accessPassId: "your_access_pass_id", 
    headline: "New Store Headline" 
  }) {
    accessPass {
      id
      headline
    }
  }
}
```

---

**Step 5: Send Chat Messages**

Post picks to live chat for active users:

```graphql
mutation createChatMessage {
  createChatMessage(input: { 
    experienceId: "EXPERIENCE_ID", 
    message: "🚨 Locking in Suns ML tonight. Anyone riding?"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

---

**Step 6: Create a Content Reward**

Encourage users to post TikToks in exchange for free days:

```graphql
mutation createContentRewardsCampaign($input: CreateCampaignInput!) {
  createContentRewardsCampaign(input: $input) {
    id
    experience {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

---

**Step 7: Send a Chat Message**

Optional — follow up with engaged users.

```graphql
mutation sendDirectMessage {
  sendDirectMessage(input: { 
    userId: "user_123", 
    message: "Saw you hit last night's parlay — appreciate you being here 🎯" 
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```
