### Step 1: Create Your App

1. Go to https://whop.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings -> API keys
3. Click the Create App button
4. Give your app a name and click Create

### Step 2: Create an Agent User

1. In the API keys section, select Edit on the ... menu for your App
2. Click the Create Agent User button
3. Enter a name and username for the agent user
4. Click Create
5. Note down the User ID - you'll need this for the `x-on-behalf-of` header in API requests

### Step 3: Set Up Your API Environment

Your API requests will need these headers:

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
x-on-behalf-of: YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID
x-company-id: YOUR_COMPANY_ID
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Step 4: Make the chat bot

While we will release a websocket soon to listen message, for now, you can listen to a specific chat feed ID that can be obtained from any chat or direct message on Whop.

```graphql
mutation {
  createAccessPass(
    input: { title: "Your Store Name", headline: "Your compelling headline" }
  ) {
    id
    route
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Set Up Pricing

Create a pricing plan with the `createPlan` mutation:

```graphql
mutation createPlan {
  createPlan(
    input: {
      accessPassId: "your_access_pass_id"
      planType: renewal
      billingPeriod: 30
      renewalPrice: 15.00
      baseCurrency: usd
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Build Your Interface

You have two options for your user interface:

### Option A: Use Whop's Chat

Perfect for agent-based applications. Send messages using:

```graphql
mutation {
  sendMessage(
    input: { experienceId: "EXPERIENCE_ID", message: "Your message here" }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

### Option B: Build a Web App

Create a full web app that embeds into Whop.com for both mobile and web platforms. This gives you more control over the UI and automatically includes basic user profile information.

## Step 7: Engage With Users

Keep your users engaged through:

1. **Regular Content Updates**

```graphql
mutation createForumPost {
  createForumPost(
    input: {
      experienceId: "exp_123"
      title: "Your Post Title"
      body: "Your valuable content here"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

2. **Dynamic Store Updates**

```graphql
mutation updateAccessPass {
  updateAccessPass(
    input: {
      accessPassId: "your_access_pass_id"
      headline: "New Store Headline"
    }
  ) {
    accessPass {
      id
      headline
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Content Rewards**

```graphql
mutation createContentRewardsCampaign($input: CreateCampaignInput!) {
  createContentRewardsCampaign(input: $input) {
    id
    experience {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Direct User Communication**

```graphql
mutation sendMessage {
  sendMessage(
    input: { toUserId: "user_123", message: "Personal engagement message" }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

## Example: Daily Sports Picks Business

Here's how a sports betting picks business would work:

1. Users subscribe to your Whop store
2. Your agent posts daily picks in a private forum/chat
3. Agent provides betting advice and game commentary
4. Users can ask questions - agent responds
5. Retain users through content rewards and engagement
