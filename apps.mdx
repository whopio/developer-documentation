## Why should I make an app

### Advantages for Companies

Developing your own apps allows your business to offer **hyper-niche** experiences catered to your unique needs. This approach not only enhances user experience, but also sets you apart from your competition.

### Advantages for Developers

As you can monetize your apps, you can take a cut every time a company users your app. This is a great way to make a passive income, without needing to deal with the hassle of marketing and sales.

## How to make an App
