---

Webhooks are a way for an application to provide real-time notifications to other systems when certain events occur. They allow you to build integrations that respond to specific events in a more efficient and scalable way than constantly polling an API for updates.

In this guide, we'll explore how to set up and implement webhooks, including establishing a webhook endpoint, configuring your webhooks, and handling webhook notifications. We'll also provide examples in both JavaScript and Python.

## Use cases

Webhooks can be utilized for various purposes, such as:

- Automatically crediting a user's account when they make a purchase.
- Displaying a banner on your website when a user's subscription is nearing expiration.
- Adding new subscribers to a custom mailing list when they sign up for a subscription.

## Webhook Types

<Note>If you are not developing an app, you can skip this section.</Note>

For [**apps**](/apps/overview), there will be two types of webhooks. One is for when a business signs up and purchases your app, and the second is when a user performs an action on a product that uses your app.

To differentiate, we have added an extra value to the webhook payload. If the webhook has to do with a user performing an action, you will see this a **company ID**:

```json
{
  "action": "",
  "company": "biz_id",
  "data": {}
}
```

However, if it is trigged by a business that owns your app, it will be `null`.

```json
{
  "action": "",
  "company": null,
  "data": {}
}
```

## Creating a webhook

Depending on your use case, you can create a webhook for a company or an app.

## Webhook Secrets

For enhanced security, you can validate that the webhook is being sent by Whop. This is a string that gets sent in the headers and is used to allow your server to verify that the request is coming from Whop. To get the signature, you need to get the webhook secret from the webhook settings.

This secret key is sent in the `X-Whop-Signature` header.
