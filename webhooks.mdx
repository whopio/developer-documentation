Webhooks are a way for an application to provide real-time notifications to other systems when certain events occur. They allow you to build integrations that respond to specific events in a more efficient and scalable way than constantly polling an API for updates.

To integrate with webhooks, you will need to set up an endpoint on your own server that will receive the webhook notifications. You will then configure your webhooks to send notifications to this endpoint, and implement handling for the webhook notifications on your server.

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up and implement an integration with webhooks, including how to set up a webhook endpoint, configure your webhooks, and handle webhook notifications. We will also provide examples of how this can be done in JavaScript & Python.

If you aren't familiar, webhooks are a widely popular form of communication between web servers. Instead of having to constantly refetch data from an API, your server will be sent updates (aka webhooks) whenever an event happens on the providers end.

## Creating a webhook

The Whop Business dashboard has a dedicated developer settings page, where you'll be able to access, update, and manage all things related to Whop API. This is where you'll begin configuring your webhook endpoint URL.

<Note>
  When you add the webhook, it will send a `POST` request to your API, unless it
  returns 200, the webhook will not be added.

## Setup a server

To receive webhooks, you must setup a server that is capable of receiving POST requests. This can be done in any language.

In this example, we are creating a server to receive data on the `/went-valid` endpoint. It then parses the relevant data from the JSON payload. From here, we can do what we want with the data, whether that is adding a user to our database or sending them a custom email.

### Hosting the server

You can host the server anywhere you want, but we recommend using a free service like [**ngrok**](https://ngrok.com/) or [**Hop.io**](https://hop.io/). Both of these providers offer a free tier that is suitable for deploying an API.

Once you have setup and deployed the server, you will need to fetch the URL you were given and add it to the webhook settings page. Make sure to add `/went-valid` to the end of the URL (or whatever the name of the endpoint is).

<CodeGroup>

```python Flask
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/went-valid', methods=['POST'])
def went_valid():
    data = request.json # Get the JSON payload

    membership_id = data['data']['id'] # This value is unique per membership
    user_id = payload['data']['user']['id'] # This is their Whop user ID
    user_email = payload['data']['user']['email']
    product_id = payload['data']['product']['id']
    plan_id = payload['data']['plan']['id']

    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

```javascript Express.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

// Use body-parser middleware to parse JSON data
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post("/went-valid", (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body;

  const membership_id = data.data.id;
  const user_id = data.data.user.id;
  const user_email = data.data.user.email;
  const product_id = data.data.product.id;
  const plan_id = data.data.plan.id;

  res.json(data);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port 3000`);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Testing your API

Enter your correct route into the modal and click the Send test webhook button. Our server will attempt to POST an example webhook event to the endpoint your provided. If your application accepts the request and returns a 200 HTTP response code, you'll see a green message saying "**Test successful**". Now, your endpoint will begin receiving events.

<Note>
  To see all the webhook payloads, check out [**events**](/webhooks/events)
