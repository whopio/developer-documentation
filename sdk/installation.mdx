While you can of course use our raw API, we have built a package for building Next.JS apps easily:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @whop/api && pnpm install -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
```

```bash npm
npm install @whop/api && npm install -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @whop/api && yarn add -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
```

</CodeGroup>

### Next Steps

Check out some of the things you can do with the SDK:

- [Run your app locally inside a Whop iFrame](/sdk/proxy)
- [Get current user](/sdk/current-user)
- [Look at the endpoints](/sdk/api)
