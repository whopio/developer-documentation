## Get Current User Details

Use the following snippet to fetch details for the current user. This will fetch more data than the `getUser` endpoint.

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

const currentUser = (await whopApi.getCurrentUser()).viewer?.user;

console.log(currentUser);
```
