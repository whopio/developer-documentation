## Upload Media File

Use the following snippet to get a presigned URL to upload a media file. You will need to provide details like filename, type, and size.

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

// The DirectUploadInput structure needs to be defined based on your GraphQL schema
// Example structure:
// interface DirectUploadInput {
//   filename: string;
//   contentType: string;
//   byteSize: number;
//   // ... other fields as required by your schema
// }

const uploadDetails = async () => {
  const input = {
    filename: "example.png",
    contentType: "image/png",
    byteSize: 102400, // 100KB example
    // Specify other necessary fields for DirectUploadInput
  };

  const response = (await whopApi.uploadMedia({input})).mediaDirectUpload;

  if (response) {
    console.log("Upload ID:", response.id);
    console.log("Upload URL:", response.uploadUrl);
    console.log("Headers:", response.headers);
    // Handle multipart upload if necessary using response.multipartUploadId and response.multipartUploadUrls
  }
};

uploadDetails();
```

After obtaining the `uploadUrl` and `headers`, you can use a standard HTTP PUT request to upload the file directly to the returned URL.
