## Check Access Pass Access

Use the following snippet to determine if a user has access to a given access pass and what their level of access is.

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

const { hasAccess, accessLevel } = (await whopApi.checkIfUserHasAccessToAccessPass({accessPassId: "prod_xxx", userId: "user_xxx"})).hasAccessToAccessPass;

console.log(hasAccess);
console.log(accessLevel);
```
