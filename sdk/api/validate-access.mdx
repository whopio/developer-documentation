description: Use this API to ensure users have access to use your app
---



Validate access to an embedded web app:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Next.js
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";
import { verifyUserToken } from "@whop/api";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

// The headers contains the user token
const headersList = await headers();

// The experienceId is a path param
// This can be configured in the Whop Dashboard, when you define your app
// TODO: EXPLAIN THIS
// TODO: look at how Knock has a glossary
const { experienceId } = await params;

// The user token is in the headers
const { userId } = await verifyUserToken(headersList);


const result = await whopApi.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
  userId,
  experienceId,
});

if (!result.hasAccessToExperience.hasAccess) {
  return <div>You do not have access to this experience</div>;
}

// Either: 'admin' | 'customer' | 'no_access';
// 'admin' means the user is an admin of the whop, such as an owner or moderator
// 'customer' means the user is a common member in this whop
// 'no_access' means the user does not have access to the whop
const { accessLevel } = result.hasAccessToExperience;

if (accessLevel === "admin") {
  return <div>You are an admin of this experience</div>;
}

if (accessLevel === "customer") {
  return <div>You are a customer of this experience</div>;
}

return <div>You do not have access to this experience</div>
```



```curl cURL
curl --location 'https://api.whop.com/public-graphql' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
--data '{
    "operationName": "CheckIfUserHasAccessToExperience",
    "variables": {
        "experienceId": "exp_123",
        "userId": "user_123"
    }
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response

The response will include whether the user has access and their access level:

```json
{
  "hasAccess": true,
  "accessLevel": "admin"
}
```

### Access Levels

- `admin`: The user is an admin of the experience
- `customer`: The user is a customer of the experience
- `no_access`: The user has no access to the experience

### Next Steps

- [Get current user](/sdk/current-user)
- [Look at the endpoints](/sdk/api)
