## Check Experience Access

Use the following snippet to determine if a user has access to a given experience and what their level of access is.

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

const { hasAccess, accessLevel } = (await whopApi.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({experienceId: "exp_xxx", userId: "user_xxx"})).hasAccessToExperience;

console.log(hasAccess);
console.log(accessLevel);
```
