## List Feed Messages

Use the following snippet to fetch messages from a feed. You'll need to provide the feed type and its ID.

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";
// Assuming FeedTypes is an enum or a set of string constants available
// e.g., FeedTypes.EXPERIENCE_FEED or "EXPERIENCE_FEED"

const feedMessages = (await whopApi.listMessages({type: "EXPERIENCE_FEED", id: "exp_xxx"})).feedPosts;

console.log(feedMessages.posts);
```
