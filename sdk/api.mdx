description: Use the SDK to use our API and return it in a formatted JSON response
---

The API SDK allows you to interact with the Whop API without having to manually write the requests. All responses are typed which gives you type safety.

## Syntax

The SDK has two main functions, `user` and `server`. These dictate if it uses the API key or access token. From here, you will be able to select which type of request you are sending, such as `GET` or `POST`. You will then need to pass the route you are requesting, and the parameters.

The parameters object is typed, so you will be able to see what parameters are available for each endpoint.

For example, if you wanted to use the `/companies/{id}` endpoint, you would pass the following parameters object:

```
{
  params: { path: { id: "biz_XXXX" } },
}
```

---

## User Mode

Use User Mode to make requests on behalf of the user. This will use the users access token to make requests. This is useful for accessing information about the user, such as their username, or email.

You will need to pass the `headers` object so the SDK can extract the access token.

### Usage

```typescript
import { WhopAPI } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const me = WhopAPI.user({ headers }).GET("/me", {});
}
```

---

## Server Mode

Use Server Mode to make requests on behalf of the company. This will use the API key to make requests. This is useful for getting information about the company, such as the company name, email, and experiences. You will need to pass the API key as a string.

You can either manually provide the API key, or the SDK will automatically fetch it from the **WHOP_API_KEY** environment variable.

### Usage

```typescript
import { WhopAPI } from "@whop-apps/sdk";

export default async function Home() {
  // Using the users access token
  const user = WhopAPI.server({ apiKey: "API_KEY" }).GET("/companies/{id}", {
    params: { path: { id: "biz_XXXX" } },
  });
}
```

<Accordion title="How to get your API Key">

To get the API key for your app, head to your [**app's settings page**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). You will then see the API Key card, where you can copy or reset your key.
