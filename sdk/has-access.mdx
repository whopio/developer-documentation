description: How to use the hasAccess function
---

This function allows you to control access to your apps by checking if a user has access to specific products, experiences, memberships, or is an authorized user of a specific company.

For example, you can:

- Ensure that a user is an authorized user of the correct company before allowing them to access a page
- Ensure that a user owns a specific product before allowing them to access a page

---

## Usage

These steps will guide you through using the `hasAccess` function to ensure only people who have purchased a specific product, are allowed to access a page.

1. **Import the functions**

Add these two imports to the top of your page:

```js
import { hasAccess } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
```

2. **Check if the user has access**

Use the `hasAccess` function to check if the user has access to a a specific product. To do this, we need to pass in an access string and the headers object.

Access strings are a way of specifying what the user needs to have access to in order to access the page. Check out the [**Expressions**](/sdk/has-access#expressions) section to learn more about access strings and what they can contain.

In this example, we are just checking if the user owns a specific product.

```js
const access = await hasAccess({ to: "prod_XXXX", headers });
```

3. **Handle the result**

If the user is authorzied, `access` will return true, and if they are not, `access` will return false.

We can then show a message to the user based on whether or not they have access.

```js
if (!access) {
  return <p>You do not have access to view this page</p>;
}
```

<Note>
  If you want to use the **Company ID**, you will need to prefix it with
  `authorized-`. To make this easier, we have created a helper function called
  `authorizedUserOn`. This function will return the correct access string for
  you, all you need to do is pass in the company ID.

For example:

`authorizedUserOn("biz_XXXX");`

will return:

`authorized-biz_XXXX`

</Note>

## Expressions

An access string is an `<expression-list>`

an `<expression-list>` is a list of `<expression>`s separated by a `-`

When evaluating the access string, the entity (user) must satisfy at least one of the expressions in the list. Ie: it is evaluated as an implicit `or` expression.

An `<expression>` is either:

- a single access control term (or primitive) EG:
  - `prod_123` meaning the user owns access to this product
  - `user_123` meaning the user is user_123
  - `authorized-biz_123` (meaning the user is an authorized user on biz_123)
  - `exp_123` meaning the user has access to this experience
  - `mem_123` meaning this membership is active and valid for the user
- a `not-` operator followed by a single `<expression>` and terminated with an underscore `_`
  - eg: `not-prod_123_` meaning the user does not own access to this product
- an `and-` operator followed by an `<expression-list>` and terminated with an underscore `_`
  - eg: `and-prod_123-user_123_` meaning the user owns access to this product _and_ is user_123
- an `or-` operator followed by an `<expression-list>` and terminated with an underscore `_`
  - eg: `or-prod_123-user_123_` meaning the user owns access to this product _or_ is user_123

This structure is recursive meaning you can nest `and` and `or` operators as well as `not` operators. For example:
`and-prod_123-or-not-user_123_-authorized-biz_123__`
would parse to:
`and(prod_123, or(not(user_123), authorized-biz_123))`
