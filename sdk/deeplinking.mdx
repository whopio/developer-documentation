title: Redirect URLs
---

Since your app is embedded within an iFrame on Whop, you cannot easily create a link that will open your app on a certain page, since you must know both the URL on your site (easy) and the URL the user is currently viewing on Whop (not so easy).

This function will create a special link that links to the current page the user is viewing on Whop.com. When your app is opened, it will not be sent to the default iFrame location you specified in your app settings, bur rather the `path` parameter you specify in this function

### Usage

```javascript
import { WhopApp } from "@lib/iframe";

const redirectUrl = await WhopApp.getRedirectUrl({
  path: "/test",
});
```
