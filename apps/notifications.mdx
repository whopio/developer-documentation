title: Send a notification
description: Send a notification to your users using the Notifications API.
---

Whop allows apps to send notifications to users and companies through the API. These get sent to the user's notification feed on the Whop website, and as a push notification to their mobile device (if they have the Whop app installed).

## Usage

To send a notification, you need to make a `POST` request to the [**/notifications**](/api-reference/v5/apps/notifications/send) endpoint.

If you are using our SDK, you can do it easily through the WhopAPI function. Here is an example of how to send the following notification:

```typescript SDK
await WhopAPI.app().POST("/app/notifications", {
  body: {
    topic_identifier: "dispatch",
    notification_data: {
      all: {
        subject: "My First Subject",
        content: "My first Content",
      },
    },
    targets: [
      {
        users: ["user_xxx"],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.whop.com/v5/notifications \
  --header 'Authorization: <authorization>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "notification_data": {
    "all": {
      "content": "My First Content",
      "subject": "My First Subject"
    }
  },
  "targets": [
    {
      "users": [
        "user_xxx"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "topic_identifier": "dispatch"
}'
```

### Topic Identifier

The `topic_identifier` is a unique identifier for the notification you want to send. You can set that up in the [Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dev):

### Notification data

In this object, there are 3 keys: `all`, `in_app`, and `mobile`.

The `in_app` key is used to send a notification to the user's notification feed either on the Whop website, or mobile app. This is useful for less important notifications, such as XXX

The `mobile` key is used to send a push notification to the user's mobile device. This is useful for important and time-sensitive notifications, such as alerting a user to a sneaker restock.

The `all` key is used to send a notification to both the user's notification feed and mobile device.

In each of these, there are the `subject` and `content` keys. The `subject` key is used to specify the subject of the notification, while the `content` key is used to specify the description of the notification.

<Note>
  If you do not use the `all` key, you must specify the `subject` and `content`
  keys in both the `in_app` and `mobile` keys.
</Note>

### Targets

The targets array is used to specify who should receive the notification. There are 4 different targets you can use:

- `users`: This takes in the `user_id` of the users you want to send the notification to.
- `products`: This takes in the `product_id` of the products you want to send the notification to, and will send it to all users who own that product.
- `companies`: This takes in the `company_id` of the companies you want to send the notification to, and will send it to all users who have an active product.
- `experiences`: Uses the `experience_id`, and will send to all users who have an active product that uses that experience.
