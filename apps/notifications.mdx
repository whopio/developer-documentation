title: Send a notification
description: Send a notification to your users using the Notifications API.

Whop allows apps to send notifications to customers and companies through the API. These get sent to the user's notification feed on the Whop website, and as a push notification to their mobile device (if they have the Whop app installed).

## Usage

To send a notification, you need to make a `POST` request to the [**/notifications**](/api-reference/v5/apps/notifications/send) endpoint.

If you are using our SDK, you can do it easily through the WhopAPI function. Here is an example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript SDK
await WhopAPI.app().POST("/app/notifications", {
  body: {
    topic_identifier: "dispatch",
    notification_data: {
      all: {
        subject: "My First Subject",
        content: "My first Content",
      },
    },
    targets: [
      {
        users: ["user_xxx"],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.whop.com/v5/notifications \
  --header 'Authorization: <authorization>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "notification_data": {
    "all": {
      "content": "My First Content",
      "subject": "My First Subject"
    }
  },
  "targets": [
    {
      "users": [
        "user_xxx"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "topic_identifier": "dispatch"
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

Using that code, the user will receive a notification with the subject "My First Subject", and the content "My First Content", like this:

### Topic Identifier

The `topic_identifier` is a unique identifier for the notification you want to send. You can set that up in the [Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dev):

### Notification data

In this object, there are 3 keys: `all`, `in_app`, and `mobile`.

The `in_app` key is used to send a notification to the user's notification feed either on the Whop website, or mobile app. This is useful for less important notifications, such as XXX

The `mobile` key is used to send a push notification to the user's mobile device. This is useful for important and time-sensitive notifications, such as alerting a user to a sneaker restock.

The `all` key is used to send a notification to both the user's notification feed and mobile device.

In each of these, there are the `subject` and `content` keys. The `subject` key is used to specify the subject of the notification, while the `content` key is used to specify the description of the notification.

<Note>
  If you do not use the `all` key, you must specify the `subject` and `content`
  keys in both the `in_app` and `mobile` keys.
</Note>

### Targets

The targets array is used to specify who should receive the notification. There are 4 different targets you can use:

- `users`: This takes in the `user_id` of the user you want to send the notification to.
- `products`: This takes in the `product_id` of the product you want to send the notification to, and will send it to all users who own that product.
- `companies`: This takes in the `company_id` of the company you want to send the notification to, and will send it to all users who have an active product.
- `experiences`: Uses the `experience_id`, and will send to all users who have an active product that uses that experience.

<Warning>
  If you use multiple targets, and a user is in multiple of those targets, they
  will receive multiple notifications.
</Warning>
