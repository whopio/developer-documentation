title: YouTube App
description: A tutorial on how to build an app that allows a seller to upload an unlisted video, and the user to play it directly on Whop
---

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a YouTube App. The app allows a seller to add a YouTube link (even unlisted ones), and then the user to play it directly on Whop through an iFrame.

The app uses:

- [Whop SDK](/sdk/installation)
- [Frosted UI](https://github.com/whopio/frosted-ui)
- [Neon Database](https://neon.tech/)
- [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Next.js Server Actions (experimental)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions)

## Prerequisites

Before we can start building, we need to make sure we created an app on Whop. If you haven't done this yet, head to the [Developer Settings](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) and create a new app.

This app will use the following URL paths:

- Seller Path: `seller/$companyId/$productId`
- Customer Path: `customer/$productId`

For more information on creating an app, check out the [Create an app](/apps/create-an-app) guide.

---

## Project Setup

Before we start building we're going to set up our database. This example uses Neon, but you can use any database you want.

### Database Setup

1. Head to the [Neon Dashboard](https://console.neon.tech/) and create a new project
2. Enter the name of your project, and select the region closest to you. We are using Postgres Version **15**.
3. Copy the connection string and save it somewhere safe. We will need it later.

Now, we need to create a table for our videos. Head to the SQL Editor and enter the following query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE videos (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    video_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    video_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    company_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    product_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP(6) DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

<Check>We have now set up our database!</Check>

---

### Next.js Setup

Now that we have set up our database, we can start building our app. This tutorial uses Next.js with the App Directory.

1. **Initialize a new project**

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm create next-app
```

```bash npm
npx create-next-app@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn create next-app
```

</CodeGroup>

2. **Install the dependancies**

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @prisma/client @whop-apps/sdk @whop/frosted-ui @prisma/client prisma
```

```bash npm
npm install @prisma/client @whop-apps/sdk @whop/frosted-ui @prisma/client prisma
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @prisma/client @whop-apps/sdk @whop/frosted-ui @prisma/client prisma
```

</CodeGroup>

3. **Create the environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```env .env.local
WHOP_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=
DATABASE_URL=
```

- `WHOP_API_KEY` is your Whop API key. You can find this in your app's settings.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID` is your Whop App ID. You can find this in your app's settings.
- `DATABASE_URL` is the connection string we copied earlier.

You can find out more about the App ID and API key [here](/apps/create-an-app#step-6-setup-your-environment-variables).

4. **Enable Server Actions**

As server actions are still an experimental feature of Next.js, we have to manually enable them. To do this, head to `next.config.js` and add the following:

```javascript next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    serverActions: true,
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

<Check>We now have set up everything we need to start building our app!</Check>

## Building the App

This section will walk you through building the app.

### Structuring the project

Before we start building, we need to structure our project. We will:

- Create the path for our seller and customer page
- Create a `lib` folder for our database client and server actions
- Create a `components` folder for our components
- Setup Frosted UI

#### Creating the paths

Create a new path inside of the `app` folder:

```
app/seller/[companyId]/[productId]/page.tsx
```

and

```
app/customer/[productId]/page.tsx
```

#### Creating the misc folders

In the root of your directory, create 2 new folders called `lib` and `components`.

#### Setting up Frosted UI

To use Frosted UI, we need to edit our `layout.tsx` and `tailwind.config.ts` files.

```javascript tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";
import preset from "@whop/frosted-ui/dist/preset";

const config = preset({
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
});
export default config;
```

Now, create a folder in the app directory called `layout.client.tsx`. This is where we will define our client layout.

```javascript layout.client.tsx
"use client"; // this line is important
import { FC, PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { TooltipProvider, Toaster } from "@whop/frosted-ui";

export const ClientLayout: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <TooltipProvider>
      {children}
      <Toaster />
    </TooltipProvider>
  );
};
```

Finally, we need to edit the `layout.tsx` file to use our new layout.

```javascript layout.tsx
import { ClientLayout } from "./layout.client";
import "./globals.css";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ClientLayout>{children}</ClientLayout>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Finally, head to `globals.css` and remove all the content except the 3 `@tailwind` imports, like so:

```css globals.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

---

### Creating the Database Client

We will be using Prisma as our ORM. Prisma is a great tool that allows us to easily interact with our database with TypeSafety. To get started, we are going to create a new file called `prisma.ts` in our `lib` folder.

```javascript db.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

export const db = new PrismaClient();
```

<Note>
  You may get an error saying that `PrismaClient` is not exported. This is
  expected and will be resolved in the next step.
</Note>

---

### Defining our schema

To make use of our ORM, we are going to define our schema. Instead of doing this manually, we will get Prisma to generate it for us. To do this, run the following command in your terminal

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm prisma init
```

```bash npm
npx prisma init
```

```bash yarn
yarn prisma init
```

</CodeGroup>

This will set up Prisma and the files needed for it to work, now we need to generate our schema.

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm prisma db pull
```

```bash npm
npx prisma db pull
```

```bash yarn
yarn prisma db pull
```

</CodeGroup>

If you check `prisma/schema.prisma` you will see that Prisma has generated our schema for us.

To make use of our schema, we need to generate a client to enable us to interact with it. This will also resolve the import error we faced earlier. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm prisma generate
```

```bash npm
npx prisma generate
```

```bash yarn
yarn prisma generate
```

</CodeGroup>

---

### Developing locally

To develop locally and see our changes on the Whop site, we need to use the `whop-proxy` command. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm whop-proxy
```

```bash npm
npm whop-proxy
```

```bash yarn
yarn whop-proxy
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Note>
  To find out more about the `whop-proxy` command, check out the
  [documentation](/sdk/whop-proxy).
</Note>

---

### Creating our Seller page

Now that we have set up our database, we can start building our seller page. This is where sellers will be able to add videos to their products.

Head to the `page.tsx` we made in the `seller/[companyId]/[productId]` folder.

**In this file we will:**

- Verify that the user is allowed to access the page
- Check our database to see if a video has already been added, and if so, pass it to the `SellerForm` component
- Render a form to add a video

```javascript page.tsx
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import SellerForm from "@/components/SellerForm";
import { db } from "@/lib/prisma";

export default async function SellerPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { companyId: string; productId: string };
}) {
  const { userId } = await validateToken({ headers });

  const currentVideo = await db.videos.findUnique({
    where: {
      product_id: params.productId,
    },
  });

  return (
    <SellerForm
      productId={params.productId}
      companyId={params.companyId}
      currentUrl={currentVideo?.video_url || null}
    />
  );
}
```

---

#### Creating the Seller Form

Since our form will be a client component, we are going to create it in a separate file. In the `components` folder we made earlier, create a new file called `SellerForm.tsx`.

This page will take in the following props:

- `companyId` - The ID of the company
- `productId` - The ID of the product that the video will be added to
- `currentUrl` - The current video URL, if one exists

Since we are using Server Actions, we need to create a FormState and FormStatus, these will let us know the status of our form, and send any error messages which we can display to the user.

If the form is successful, we will display a success toast, otherwise, we will display an error message on the input.

```javascript components/SellerForm.tsx
"use client";
import { Input, Button, toast, Toaster } from "@whop/frosted-ui";
import { experimental_useFormState as useFormState } from "react-dom";
import { experimental_useFormStatus as useFormStatus } from "react-dom";
import addYoutubeLink from "@/lib/actions";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const initialState = {
  message: null,
  errorMessage: null,
};

export default function SellerForm({
  companyId,
  productId,
  currentUrl,
}: {
  companyId: string;
  productId: string;
  currentUrl: string | null;
}) {
  const [state, formAction] = useFormState(addYoutubeLink, initialState);
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (state?.message === "success") {
      toast.success("Successfully added YouTube link!");
    }
  }, [state?.message]);

  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-200 via-gray-300 to-gray-200">
      <div className="bg-white w-[600px] p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
        <h1 className="text-lg text-center font-semibold mb-4">YouTube App</h1>
        <form action={formAction}>
          <input type="hidden" name="companyId" value={companyId} />
          <input type="hidden" name="productId" value={productId} />
          <div className="mb-4">
            <Input
              label={{
                children: "YouTube URL",
                tooltip: {
                  description:
                    "The URL of the YouTube video you want your users to watch.",
                },
              }}
              messageIcon
              placeholder="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
              size="md"
              className="w-full"
              name="url"
              errorMessage={state?.errorMessage}
              defaultValue={currentUrl || ""}
            />
          </div>
          <Button isLoading={pending} type="submit" className="w-full">
            Submit
          </Button>
        </form>
      </div>
      <Toaster />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

#### Creating the Server Action

Now that we have created our form, we need to create the server action that will handle the form submission. Create a new file called `actions.ts` in the `lib` folder.

**In this file, we are:**

- Creating a server action that will:
  - Extract the video ID from the URL
  - Upsert the video in our database
  - Return success or error messages

```javascript lib/actions.ts
"use server";
import { db } from "./prisma";

function extractYoutubeVideoId(url: string): string | null {
  const regex =
    /(?:youtube\.com\/(?:[^\/\n\s]+\/\S+\/|(?:v|e(?:mbed)?)\/|\S*?[?&]v=)|youtu\.be\/)([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11})/;
  const match = url.match(regex);
  return match && match[1] ? match[1] : null;
}

export default async function addYoutubeLink(
  prevState: any,
  formData: FormData
) {
  try {
    const url = formData.get("url") as string;
    const companyId = formData.get("companyId") as string;
    const productId = formData.get("productId") as string;

    if (!url || !companyId || !productId) {
      return { errorMessage: "Missing data" };
    }

    const youtubeUrlRegex =
      /^(https?:\/\/)?(www\.)?(youtube\.com|youtu\.?be)\/.+$/;
    if (!youtubeUrlRegex.test(url)) {
      return { errorMessage: "Invalid YouTube URL format" };
    }

    const videoId = extractYoutubeVideoId(url);
    if (!videoId) {
      return { errorMessage: "Could not extract YouTube video ID" };
    }

    await db.videos.upsert({
      where: { product_id: productId },
      update: { video_id: videoId, video_url: url },
      create: {
        company_id: companyId,
        product_id: productId,
        video_id: videoId,
        video_url: url,
      },
    });

    return { message: "success" };
  } catch (e) {
    return { errorMessage: "Failed to create" };
  }
}

```

<Check>
  We have now created our seller page! If you head to the seller page, you
  should be able to add a video URL and see it in your database.
</Check>

---

### Creating the Customer page

The customer page will be what the users see when they click on the app. It will display the YouTube video in an embed, and allow them to watch it.

This will be done in the `customer/[productId]/page.tsx` file.

**In this file we will:**

- Fetch the video from our database using the `productId`
- Render the video in an iFrame
- Display an error message if there was no video found

```javascript page.tsx
import { db } from "@/lib/prisma";

export default async function CustomerPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { productId: string };
}) {

  const videoId = await db.videos.findUnique({
    where: { product_id: params.productId },
    select: { video_id: true },
  });

  return (
    <div className="relative w-screen h-screen flex items-center justify-center m-0">
      {videoId ? (
        <iframe
          className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
          src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${videoId.video_id}`}
          allowFullScreen
        />
      ) : (
        <p className="text-center">
          I could not find a video to play, please contact the seller
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Check>
  We have now created our customer page! If you purchase your product and test
  it, you should see your YouTube video. You have now created a fully functional
  app!
</Check>

---

## Next steps

Now that we have created the app, we need to host it so anyone can use it. We recommend using Vercel, but you can use any hosting provider you want.

<Tip>
  Make sure to keep your environment variables secret and don't commit them to
  your repository.
