Apps allow anyone to create custom experiences on Whop and monetize them. There are two types of apps you can sell on Whop:

- **Consumer Apps**: These are made with the end-users - the consumers - in mind. Developers create these apps for businesses, intending for the business to add this as part of their product offering. For example, there is an app that allows merchants to stream, but only to paying members. The business (streamer) could add this app to their product, and then stream through it, allowing only paying members to view the stream.

- **Business Apps**: These are designed for the merchants on Whop, allowing them to do more on the platform. For example, an app could be made that enables merchants to send SMS messages to their users.

Your app integrates into Whop using an **iFrame**, giving a native interface. This opens up the possibility to use various web technologies for app development, be it React, Vue, Angular, or others. To further streamline the development process, we've created a TypeScript SDK that aids in browser interactions, API connectivity, and more.
