Apps allow **anyone** to create an experience and sell it on Whop, whether you are a **company** looking to gain an edge over competitors with a custom experience, or a **developer** selling your app to other companies, allowing them to give their users experiences they wouldn't otherwise be able to have.

The most common apps that people build enable companies to sell more types of content to users, such as **calendar bookings**, **physical goods**, etc. The other style of apps are **business-focused**. These are designed to improve workflow, and give them more resources to run their business. Examples of these include **Dispute Fighters**, **Email Marketing**, etc.

Apps work by embedding an **iFrame** into Whop, giving a native feel to the experience. This means that you can use any web technology to build your app, such as React, Vue, Angular, etc. We also provide a [**TypeScript SDK**](/sdk) to make it easier to interact with the browser, API, and more!

## Why should I make an app

### Advantages for Companies

Developing your own apps allows your business to offer **hyper-niche** experiences catered to your unique needs. This approach not only enhances user experience (UX) but also sets you apart from your competition.

### Advantages for Developers

As you can monetize your apps, you can take a cut every time a company users your app. This is a great way to make a passive income, without needing to deal with the hassle of marketing and sales.
