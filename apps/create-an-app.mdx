---

In this guide, you will learn how to create a Whop App from scratch, using Next.js.

---

## Creating an app in Whop

[THIS WILL BE A SECTION ON HOW TO CREATE AN APP IN THE DEVELOPER PAGE - BLOCKED BY UX FLOWS]

---

## Setting up your environment

This guide uses Next.js, so you will need to setup a Next.js project.

```bash
yarn create next-app
```

<Note>
  This guide uses the [**App Directory**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), so we
  recommend you to use the same name for your project.
</Note>

---

### Installing the Whop App SDK

We have created our own package to make it easier to integrate Whop into your application. You will need to install the following package:

```bash
yarn add @whop-apps/sdk
```

<Note>
  For more information on what the Whop SDK can do, head to [**this
  page**](/apps/sdks).
</Note>

---

### Installing Frosted UI (Optional)

[**Frosted UI**](https://storybook.whop.com) is a UI library created by Whop, it contains all the components used to build [**Whop**](https://whop.com). Although it is not required, we recommend you use it to keep the same look and feel as the rest of the platform.

```bash
yarn add @whop/frosted-ui
```

For more information on how to install Frosted UI, click [**here**](/apps/frosted)

<Tip>
  We recommend using Frosted as it will sync color preferences with the user's
  Whop preference.
</Tip>

### Environment Variables - [NEEDS ATTENTION]

For the Whop SDK to work, you will need to add the following environment variables:

- `WHOP_JWK_PK`: Public key used to verify JWTs. Encoded as a **JWK**. Exposed publicly on the [**Whop Dashboard**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). TODO: actually expose this on the dashboard.
- `WHOP_API_KEY`: **API key** used to access the Whop API. Get this from the app developer page on the [**Whop Dashboard**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID`: **APP ID** of the current app. Get this from the app developer page on whop dashboard. Looks like: `app_XXXXXXXX`

<Note>
  When deploying your app, make sure these **are not hard-coded**. We recommend
  you use `.env.local` and to add it to your `.gitignore` file. This will
  prevent you from accidentally exposing your keys.
</Note>

## Setting up your pages

Once you have got the project created and the preresiquites installed, you can start creating your pages.

---

### Page Variables

You will need context about the **current company** and **experience ID**, this ensures that your app is **scoped** to the correct company and experience. These get passed as a **page prop**, defined dynamically in the URL. For example:

```
https://domain.com/admin/${company_id}/${experience_id}/
```

There are **3 variables** that you can access:

- `experienceId` - The ID of the current experience
- `companyId` - The ID of the current company
- `membershipId` - The ID of the current membership (only available on the consumers view)

This path needs to be set in the **Apps settings**, you can do so [**here**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer):

<Frame
  caption="Make sure all variable names are formatted correctly. They should be pre-fixed
  with `$`"
>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TB1Q8ja.png" />
</Frame>

For instance, the file structure based on the earlier example would appear like:

```bash
cool-app/
├─ app/
│  ├─ admin/
│  │  ├─ [companyId]/
│  │  │  ├─ [experienceId]/
│  │  │  │  ├─ page.tsx
```

---

#### Accessing the variables in Next.js

```typescript
export default async function AdminPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { companyId: string; experienceId: string };
}) {
  const companyId = params.companyId;
  const experienceId = params.experienceId;
}
```

---

### Authenticating a user

To ensure that the user is authenticated, we can add the following line of code:

```typescript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";

export default async function AdminPage() {
  await validateToken({ headers });
}
```

This will validate the users token, and throw an error if the token is invalid.
