Once you have the project created and the preresiquites installed, you can start creating your pages. This section will cover how to pass information about the user to your app, and how to authenticate the user.

### Page Variables

TODO To give the app information about the signed in user, and details about the company, product, etc, we have added the ability to pass variables to the page through the URL. This allows you to create dynamic pages, and to access the data you need. For example, getting information about the membership attached to the user. An example of a URL would be:

```
https://domain.com/hub/{companyId}/{productId}
```

Here are the variables you can access when the user is accessing your app:

<Accordion title="Consumer Page" >

Here are the variables you can access when the user is accessing your app after purchasing:

| Variable Name    | Description                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **productId**    | The ID of the product.            |
| **companyId**    | The ID of the company     |
| **membershipId** | The ID of the membership |
| **planId**       | The ID of the plan         |

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Company Page">

Here are the variables you can access from the dashboard once the app has been added to a product.

| Variable Name    | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **productId**    | The ID of the product the user is accessing.     |
| **companyId**    | The ID of the company the experience belongs to. |

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

To build your URLs, visit the settings page for your app [**here**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer)

For instance, the file structure based on the earlier example would appear like:

```bash
cool-app/
├─ app/
│  ├─ hub/
│  │  ├─ [companyId]/
│  │  │  ├─ [productId]/
│  │  │  │  ├─ page.tsx
```

Once we have setup the correct structure in our project, we now need to retrieve the variables from the URL. In Next.js, this can be achieved with the following code:

```typescript
export default async function HomePage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { companyId: string; productId: string };
}) {
  const companyId = params.companyId;
  const productId = params.productId;
}
```

### Authenticating a user

To ensure that the user is authenticated, we can add the following line of code:

```typescript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";

export default async function HomePage() {
  await validateToken({ headers });
}
```

This will validate the users token, and throw an error if the token is invalid.

You have now learned how to setup your project, the next step is learn how to use our API, and deploy your app to production.
