Once you have the project created and the preresiquites installed, you can start creating your pages. This section will cover how to pass information about the user to your app, and how to authenticate the user.

Your app can have two different views, one for the company, and the other for the consumer. The **consumer view** is the page that the user will see when they are accessing your app from their **orders page**. The **company view** is the page that the company will see when they are accessing your app from the **dashboard**.

### Page Variables

To allow for your app to get information about the product and company, we have created a set of variables that can be passed to your app through the URL. For example, if an app wants to generate a code for all its users, it won't know which business is using it, so they will need format their URL like this to get that information:

```
https://domain.com/admin/{companyId}
```

This will then set the URL to be something like this, allowing the app to extract the ID of the company:

```
https://domain.com/admin/biz_XXX
```

Another example would be that if the app needs to know the ID of the product, so it can fetch the correct data from its database, they will format their URL like this:

```
https://domain.com/user/{productId}
```

Here are the variables you can access when the user is accessing your app:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Consumer Page" >

Here are the variables you can access when the user is accessing your app after purchasing:

| Variable Name    | Description              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| **productId**    | The ID of the product.   |
| **companyId**    | The ID of the company    |
| **membershipId** | The ID of the membership |
| **planId**       | The ID of the plan       |

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Company Page">

Here are the variables you can access from the dashboard once the app has been added to a product.

| Variable Name | Description                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **productId** | The ID of the product the user is accessing.     |
| **companyId** | The ID of the company the experience belongs to. |

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

To build your URLs, visit the settings page for your app [**here**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer)

For instance, the file structure based on the earlier example would appear like:

```bash
cool-app/
├─ app/
│  ├─ user/
│  │  ├─ [productId]/
│  │  │  ├─ page.tsx
```

Once we have setup the correct structure in our project, we now need to retrieve the variables from the URL. In Next.js, this can be achieved with the following code:

```typescript
export default async function HomePage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { productId: string };
}) {
  const productId = params.productId;
}
```

### Authenticating a user

To ensure that the user is authenticated and is allowed to access your app, you will need to validate their authentication cookie. This can be done with the following code using the SDK:

```typescript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";

export default async function HomePage() {
  await validateToken({ headers });
}
```

This will validate the users token, and throw an error if the token is invalid. We strongly recommend that you add this to all pages of your app.

If you are not using the SDK, you can still implement this functionality.

You have now learned how to setup your project, the next step is learn how to use our API, and deploy your app to production.
