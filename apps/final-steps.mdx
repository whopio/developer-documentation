This page will guide you through the final steps of creating and selling your App on Whop.

## Using our API

We have created a simple API that allows you to fetch information about you may need for your app. We have wrapped this in a TypeScript SDK that handles authentication and other things for you. You can find the SDK [here](/sdk).

If you do not want to use the SDK, you can still use all the same endpoints. All of our endpoints are listed in the sidebar. We have also created a playground that allows you to test out the API and see what data is returned without having to write out the code.

## Hosting your app

Once your app is ready to be distributed to users, you will need to deploy it. We recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host your app, but you can use any hosting provider you want.

Once you have your domain, you can insert it in the `Website URL` field on the [**App Settings**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) page.

<Tip>
  There is no need to purchase a custom domain, the user will never get to see
  it.
