## Creating an app on Whop

<Tip>
  If you have not yet created a company on Whop, you can learn how to do so
  [**here**](https://docs.whop.com/creating-company).
</Tip>

Once you have your company setup, you need to head to the [**Developer Settings Page**](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer). From here, you should click the `Create App` button.

It is important to do this before you begin developing, as you will need some credentials from the App to starting development.

## Adding the App to a product

Once you have created your app, you will need to add it to a product so you can start testing it. Creating an app will automatically create a new product with the same name, we recommend you use this one for testing and **do not** add the app to an active product until it is ready for production.

When you are asked what to add to a product, click on the icon that has the same name as your app, it will also be the last item on the grid.

<Note>
  It is normal to see the error message occur when you first add the app to a
  product. This will happen if you have not added a Product URL to it. We will
  explain in this guide how to do that.

## Simulating a customer

Once you have added the app to the test product, your next step is to create a pricing plan for the app. This will allow you to purchase the product yourself (for free) and test the app as if you were a customer.

You should also mark the product as hidden, so people won't see it on your product page.

Once you have created the pricing plan, you can now purchase the product, and emulate being a user.

After checking out, you will be able to see it in your [**orders page**](whop.com/orders).
