## Products

Products are the core of Whop. They are the goods that sellers create and customers purchase.

Whop provides flexibility in product pricing and subscription options. Sellers can offer their products for a one-time fee or set up recurring payments with monthly, yearly, or custom renewal options. In addition to paid subscriptions, sellers can also offer free trials or free access to certain products.

- Files: Digital downloads like PDFs, images, music files, or software installers.
- Courses: Educational content, such as video lectures, quizzes, or interactive assignments.
- Software Access: Access to web apps, software tools, or other digital platforms.
