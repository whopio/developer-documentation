## Building a chatbot

We'll build an agentic Whop application that plugs into the API in order to manage a user's DMs. At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a good idea of how to interact with the DM API.

You can use this application to either manage the agent's own DMs, or to manage your own DMs on your behalf.

I'll be using Python and FastAPI for these examples, but you can use any language you want.

---

### **Step 1: Get your API key**

Before we get started, you'll need to get an API key for your Whop. If you do not have a Whop already, create one [here](https://whop.com/new/).

Then get the API key and App ID. Instructions available [here](/instructions/get-api-key).

---

### **Step 2: Install FastAPI and set up a basic server**

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

At this point, you should be able to see the "Hello World" message by going to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Alternatively, you can query the API using a tool like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

---

### **Step 3: Read DMs on demand**

Choose which DMs feed you want to read. We'll need the `id` of the feed, which you can find in the URL of the feed. Feed IDs are formatted like this: `feed_123`.

Set the headers for the request to include your API key.

```python
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {WHOP_AGENT_API_KEY}",
}
```

If you want to read your DMs instead of the agent's, you can add the additional header `

```python
"x-on-behalf-of": WHOP_USER_USER_ID
```

Now, we can read fetch a DM.

```python
full_query = """query DmsFeedData($feedId: ID!, $postsLimit: Int!) {
    dmsFeedData(feedId: $feedId, postsLimit: $postsLimit) {
          posts {
            content
            user {
                username
                id
            }
        }
    }
}"""

payload = {
    "query": full_query, 
    "variables": {
        "feedId": feed_id, 
        "postsLimit": 1
    }
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql", headers=headers, json=payload
)
response_json = response.json()
print(response_json)

if len(response_json["data"]["dmsFeedData"]["posts"]) > 0:
    latest_post = response_json["data"]["dmsFeedData"]["posts"][0]
    message_content = latest_post["content"]
    print(latest_post)
else:
    print("No DMs found")
```

This will fetch the most recent DM from the feed. You can change the `postsLimit` to fetch more or fewer DMs.

We are fetching the content of the most recent DM, as well as the user that sent it's username and ID. There are many more fields available, you can see the full list [here](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/whop-public-gql/variant/current/schema/reference/objects/DmsPost).

Let's include some logic to make sure that the most recent DM is from the other user.

```python
user_id = latest_post["user"]["id"]

if user_id == WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID:
    print("Last DM sent from the agent")
    return {"message": "Last DM sent from the agent"}
else:
    print("Last DM sent from the user, continuing...")
```

---

### **Step 4: Generate a response**

Connect to an LLM to generate a response to the DM. In this example, we'll use the `openai` library.

```bash
pip install openai
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": message_content
        }
    ]
)

response = completion.choices[0].message.content
print(response)
```

Great! Now we've fetched the latest DM, seen if it's from the other user, and if so, generated a response.

---

### **Step 5: Sending the response back to Whop**

We're almost ready to send the response back to Whop. We just need to format the response in the correct way. We'll need a couple of helper methods in order to do this.

First, we need to use a specific rich content format for the response. Below is a helper method that formats a (plaintext) string into the correct format.

```python
def to_rich_tiptap_format(input_string: str) -> str:
    tiptap = {
        "attrs": {"is_streamed_node": False},
        "type": "doc",
        "content": [
            {
                "content": [{"marks": [], "type": "text", "text": input_string}],
                "type": "paragraph",
            }
        ],
    }
    return json.dumps(tiptap)
```

```python
response_formatted = to_rich_tiptap_format(response)
```

We also need a specific ID format in order to work with Whop. Below is a method that helps us generate this.

```python
import secrets
import struct
import time

def base58_encode_16_bytes(data: bytes) -> str:
    base58_alphabet = "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    int_data = int.from_bytes(data, byteorder="big")
    result = ""
    while int_data > 0:
        int_data, remainder = divmod(int_data, 58)
        result = base58_alphabet[remainder] + result
    result = "1" * (22 - len(result)) + result
    return result


def generate_feed_temporal_id() -> str:
    time_bytes = 6
    total_bytes = 16
    actual_timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000)
    timestamp_bytes = struct.pack(">Q", actual_timestamp)[-time_bytes:]
    random_bytes = secrets.token_bytes(total_bytes - time_bytes)
    id_bytes = timestamp_bytes + random_bytes
    id_str = base58_encode_16_bytes(id_bytes)
    return f"feed_{id_str}"
```

```python
post_id = generate_feed_temporal_id()
```

Now, we should be able to send the response back to Whop.

```python
full_query = """mutation ProcessEntities($input: ProcessEntitiesInput!) {
    processEntities(input: $input) {
        entities {
            id
        }
    }
}"""

payload = {
    "query": full_query,
    "variables": {
        "input": {
            "appId": WHOP_APP_ID,
            "dmsPosts": [
                {
                    "feedId": feed_id,
                    "feedType": "dms_feed",
                    "content": plain_text[:4096], # there is a limit on len(content), but not on len(richContent)
                    "richContent": rich_content,  # richContent is what is actually displayed in the UI
                    "id": post_id,
                }
            ],
        }
    },
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql", 
    headers=headers,    # use the same headers as before
    json=payload
)
```

And we're done! You should see your response in the DM feed.

Any time you want to send a response, you run this script.

## Next Steps

What we've built is still pretty manual. We're reading the DMs on demand, and sending a response each time.

We can plug into websockets to get real-time updates on DMs, and send responses as they come in, so no manual polling is needed.

More docs on how to do this coming soon!
