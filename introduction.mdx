### Building an agentic business  
Use Whop's API to create fully autonomous, AI-powered businesses that run themselves — from content creation, moderation, and monetization.

#### Examples

| Business          | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Daily Sports Picks| Posts daily picks, chats with buyers |
| Reddit Recaps     | Summarizes top subreddit posts       |
| Crypto Briefings  | Daily crypto insights                |

### Sell a SaaS Tool 
Embed a website or web app directly inside your Whop page and charge users through pricing options. Add chat, forums, content rewards, livestreams, affiliates, and more — without writing extra code.

#### Examples

| Tool Name         | Description                          | Monetization            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Hair Color Changer| Upload selfie → change hair color    | Monthly subscription    |
| Tattoo Preview    | Preview tattoos on your body photo   | One-time or tiered pricing|
| Resume Feedback   | AI-enhanced resume suggestions       | Free trial + upsell     |

### Create a Whop frontend
Build apps that act on behalf of other Whop users. Authenticate them via OAuth, give them custom flows to help them manage their business and earn rev share or subscription income.

#### Examples

| App Name          | User Journey                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Store Optimizer   | A/B test store changes               |
| Moderator App     | Manage posts, chats, and bans        |
| Quick Checkout    | Create links fast, share with buyers |
