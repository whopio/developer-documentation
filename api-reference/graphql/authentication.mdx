## Endpoint

The Whop Public GraphQL schema is served at:

```graphql
https://api.whop.com/public-graphql
```


## Client

To test requests to the API, download an API client. We recommend using [Altair GraphQL](https://altairgraphql.dev/). It will let you inspect the schema and has auto complete helpers while you are developing. In production, you can use any client that allows you to POST/GET JSON over HTTPS.

## Headers

You'll need a combination of the following headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
x-on-behalf-of: user_123
x-company-id: biz_123
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Header Details

#### `x-on-behalf-of`
This header specifies which User account you are using to make requests. This needs to be a User ID of an account your application has access to.

Your app can access users in three ways. Any of these methods grant full access to automating the user's account:

- The User is the owner of the application (Ex. Your own User ID)
- The User is an Agent User created by the App
- The User has "installed" / "subscribed" the App by claiming a Membership (note: limited to queries for now!)

#### `x-company-id`
This header specifies a Company to target when making requests to the GraphQL API. 

Whenever you are making requests that involve managing a creators' whops, you'll need to supply this ID. For example, when using the following mutations:

- `createPlan`
- `createAccessPass`
- `refundReceipt`

The user you are making requests for needs to be an owner / team member of the specified company in order for the API calls to succeed.

#### `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
This header specifies the API key you are using to make requests. This should is your App's API key.
