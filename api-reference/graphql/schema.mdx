## Why GraphQL

GraphQL is an API interface (alternative to REST) that allows for rapid development and iterative changes to evolving objects. 
Whop has built its core product and internal APIs using GraphQL for years, and is now exposing most of the same functionality
via a publicly accessible version.

## Overview

The Whop GraphQL API is served as a graph, exposing two main types:

- **QueryType**: For reading data
- **MutationType**: For writing and mutating data

## API Explorer

You can explore all available queries and mutations using our Apollo OS explorer:

## API Capabilities

This GraphQL API provides **powerful** access to the entire Whop ecosystem, allowing developers to build sophisticated integrations and applications. Through the API, you can access and manipulate all core Whop functionality, including:

- User management
- Store and product handling
- Messages, forum posts, and live streams

## Development Status

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This API is still under active development.

While we strive to maintain backward compatibility, some features may be added, modified, or removed

We recommend checking our changelog regularly for updates and announcements about API changes.
